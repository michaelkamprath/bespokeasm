      All new features and bug fixes should follow Test Driven Development (TDD) practices.
      - Write or update tests before implementing new code or fixing bugs.
      - Ensure all tests pass before considering a change complete.
      - Prefer small, incremental changes with corresponding tests.
      - If a feature is hard to test, discuss how to make it more testable.
