      All new features and bug fixes should follow Test Driven Development (TDD) practices.
      - Write or update tests before implementing new code or fixing bugs.
      - Ensure all tests pass before considering a change complete.
      - Prefer small, incremental changes with corresponding tests.
      - If a feature is hard to test, discuss how to make it more testable.
      - The AI assistant should automatically run relevant test commands (e.g., `python3 -m unittest`)
        after code or test changes, unless explicitly instructed not to.
      - The AI assistant should also run shell commands for codebase searches, dependency checks,
        or other validation steps as needed, unless explicitly instructed not to.
