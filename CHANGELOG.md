## TODO
Changes that are planned but not implemented yet:

* Add ability for an instruction to have order agnostic operands. That is, `instr a, b` is the same as `instr b, a`. This allows `swap` to occupy less instruction space.

## [Unreleased]

## 0.1.4
First tracked released
* Enabled the `reverse_argument_order` instruction option be applied to a specific operand configuration. This slightly changed the configuration file format.
* Added ability for instructions with operands to have a single "empty operand" variant, e.g., `pop`
